Learning to Dance
=================

A hands-on training session at LPW 2011 on using Dancer.

In this lesson you'll be implementing a website for accessing an airport search engine based on Dancer.

Doing the exercises you'll learn how Dancer is used, and how the code should be structured to make a site easy to change and maintain. 



What's Dancer?
--------------

Dancer is a micro 'web framework' - a toolkit for developing a dynamic web application.  It is inspired by the Ruby framework, Sinatra.

Prerequisites
-------------
Basic knowledge of:

* Perl (no need for OO Perl)
* HTML/HTTP 
* A text editor like vi/emacs/pico

Preparation
-----------

* Bring a laptop with an ssh client (e.g. PuTTY or MINGW/MSYS if it's Windows)

Getting Started
---------------
* Login to lpw.illywhacker.net as per the printout received on arrival
* Checkout the learning materials

```
git clone git://github.com/andrewsolomon/training.dancer.lpw.2011.git
```

* When you've done an exercise, view the result at http://lpw.illywhacker.net:[Your Port Number]


Instructions
------------
Do your exercises in the directories

```
training.dancer.lpw.2011/exercises/part1/ex1 
training.dancer.lpw.2011/exercises/part1/ex2
...
```
and if you get stuck, you'll find solutions in 

```

```

Paths to take
-------------
The lesson is divided into two sections:

* Part 1: https://github.com/andrewsolomon/training.dancer.lpw.2011/blob/master/slides/part1.md

This provides you with the basic toolkit of skills for implementing a web site. 

* Part 2: https://github.com/andrewsolomon/training.dancer.lpw.2011/blob/master/slides/part2.md

This is where the interface to the search engine is implemented. If you just want to cut to the chase, you can skip some of the exercises as follows:
