Learning to Dance
=================

A hands-on training session at LPW 2011 on using Dancer.

In this lesson you'll be implementing a website for accessing an airport search engine based on Dancer.

Doing the exercises you'll learn how Dancer is used, and how the code should be structured to make a site easy to change and maintain.

Getting Started
---------------
* Login to lpw.illywhacker.net as per the printout received on arrival
* Browse to http://lpw.illywhacker.net

Instructions
------------
Do your exercises in the directories

Paths to take
-------------
The lesson is divided into two sections:

* Part 1: https://github.com/andrewsolomon/training.dancer.lpw.2011/blob/master/slides/part1.md

This provides you with the basic toolkit of skills for implementing a web site. 

* Part 2: https://github.com/andrewsolomon/training.dancer.lpw.2011/blob/master/slides/part2.md

This is where the interface to the search engine is implemented. If you just want to cut to the chase, you can skip some of the exercises as follows:
