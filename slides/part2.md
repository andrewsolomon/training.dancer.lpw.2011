Implementing an MVC web application
====================================================

Our project is to implement a single page website like this:

![Index Page](https://github.com/andrewsolomon/training.dancer.lpw.2011/raw/master/slides/images/index.png "Index page")

![Results Page](https://github.com/andrewsolomon/training.dancer.lpw.2011/raw/master/slides/images/results.png "Results page")


It will be similar to the elementary website we just developed, but
because it's larger and more complex we'll need to give it more
structure, separating things out a bit more so that the code is easy to
understand and maintain.

The structure we use in this section is the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
framework. A <b>model</b> is the code which accesses and manipulates the data. The
<b>view</b> is (in our case) the HTML/Template Toolkit file which dictates how
the output is presented to the user.  The <b>controller</b> is the code which
connects a URL with a view, and uses a module to populate a view with
the appropriate data.

Play with the script below to understand how it works. We'll be
calling the modules Airport::Data and Airport::Search it's based on
from our website controller.

``` 

$ cd code/part2/airport-toolkit
$ ./bin/search_airports --matching riga --word
$ ./bin/search_airports --latitude  56.923 --longitude 23.9710   \
    --number 3 --distance 0.01

```

Exercise 1. Implement the skeleton described below
===================================================

The following code is a skeleton on which you'll be building
the website. Save these files in the specified locations
and complete the template so that the site runs without errors.

A) The script: ``` part2/ex1/wsa ```

This is surprisingly minimal, but we're putting
all the route handlers into Airport::Controller
and the 'set' calls are being replaced with 
the contents of a config file

```perl

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Dancer;
use Airport::Controller;


Dancer->dance;

```

B) The config file: ``` part2/ex1/config.yml ```

Instead of having 'set' calls in the perl code
we're putting all the settings in a config file
which can be changed without modifying the code.


```

engines:
  template_toolkit:
    start_tag: '[%'
    stop_tag: '%]'

template: 'template_toolkit'

logger: 'console'
log: 'debug'
show_errors: 1

```

<b>NOTE</b> Remember the "banana skin" (in Part 1 exercise 4)?
Because we've put engines and template into a config file
the ordering no longer matters.

 
C) The handlers module ``` part2/ex1/lib/Airport/Controller.pm ```

```perl

package Airport::Controller;
use Dancer;


get '/' => sub {
  template 'index';
};

get '/results' => sub {
  my $searchstring = params->{searchstring};
  template 'index' => {
    searchstring => $searchstring,
    searchresults => [
      { name => 'Kentucky Fried Airport', iso_country => 'Kentucky' },
      { name => 'McAirport', iso_country => 'United State of Texas' },
    ],

  };
};

1;

```


D) The template ``` views/index.tt ```

```

<html>
<head><title>Find an Airport</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Find an Airport</h1>

<form action="results" method="get">
  <input type="text" name="searchstring" value="[%searchstring%]"/><br />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

[% IF searchresults %]
<h2> Search Result </h2>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Country</b></td></tr>

-----> FIXME: ADD THE FOREACH LOOP TO FILL IN COLUMNS HERE

</table>
[% END %]


</body>
</html>

```

NOTE: ```wsa``` and the ```config.yml``` have to be in the directory containing the
'views' and 'lib' subdirectories otherwise ```wsa``` needs to be told where to
look for everything.

Move on to Exercise 2 once you've changed views/index.tt to display 
the aiports being sent back from the controller.

Exercise 2: Start using the Toolkit
===================================

In this exercise we start using the airport-toolkit
   
A) Toss in the ingredients

```
$ cp -r ex1 ex2
$ cp -r airport-toolkit/* ex2
```
Add to ``` config.yml ``` 

the line

``` 
airports_csv: 'data/iata_airports.csv' 
```

B) Edit ``` Airport::Controller ``` so that it loads the array of 
airports generated with ``` Airport::Data::parse_airports ``` 
into a package variable which will be used in 
the search function.

<b>NOTES</b> 

* Due to the config settings above, the filename to 
pass into Airport::Data::parse_airports is setting('airports_csv')

* For hints at how this is done, look at ``` bin/search_airports ```

* the array of airports should be declared and populated outside a
subroutine so it is only populated the first time the ``` Airport::Controller ```
module is loaded rather than every time we do a search.

C) Add the number of airports line to the top of the ``` index/results ``` page
as in the example 'screenshots' above using the number of 
elements in the array value being passed to the template.



Exercise 3:  Taking the hint
============================

Decide on whether to search for airports by location or by name by analysing the user's input.

```
$ cp -r ex2 ex3
```

Instead of just writing 'Found X airports from 6372'
below the search result it would be more informative to say

```
'Found X airports from 6372 - searching by location'
```

or

```
'Found X airports from 6372 - searching by name'
```

Use ``` Airport::Data::parse_search_string ``` to process the user's input.


Exercise 4: Give up on dancing metaphors
=========================================
This is where we display the correct search results

```
$ cp -r ex3 ex4
```

Use ```Airport::Search::get_name_matching_airports ```
or ```Airport::Search::get_latlong_matching_airports ``` to populate the 
search results with the correct data.

Also - turn 'X' into the number of airports found.

Dance the night away...
===============================

<!--  * <b>Exercise 5</b> Make the search get_name_matching_airports case insensitive
and update its test script accordingly -->

* <b>Exercise 5</b> For each airport, if it has a home_link, make it a link when
you click on the airport name.

* <b>Exercise 6</b> Place another link to the right of each link to get the airports
near this one (1 degree circumference)

... and dancing on speed
=========================
* <b>Exercise 10</b> Let dancer lead this time:

```
$ mkdir part3
$ cd part3
$ man dancer
$ dancer -a Airport
...
```
